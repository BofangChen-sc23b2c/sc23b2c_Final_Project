# University of Leeds Graduation Project: Automated Malware Detection Using Machine Learning 
The experiments first constructed constructed heterogeneous and homogeneous graphs based on the dataset, and then trained a graph neural network model which converted the raw data into feature vectors, 
thus providing effective learning features for subsequent machine learning models. 
The experiments were further conducted to evaluate multiple machine learning models to identify the most suitable model to solve the malware detection problem through multiple evaluation metrics.
This experiment uses the dataset from the Alibaba Tenchi competition, the link to the dataset is below:
